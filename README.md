## Some Programing codes of some good problems. ##
- Include both algorithmic and common logical problems codes.
- codes mainly in `C` and `C++` programming language.

### Just cut paste the code into your system and run(compile) it. ###

#### Includes program of types: ####
- recursion
- datastructure
- sorting
- basic patterns





#### Included codes of: ####
* suduko  ``` ./recursion/suduko.cpp``` 
* patterns  ```. basic_patterns/patt1\2\3.c  with their screen shots```
* DS codes ``` Includes queue,stack,postfix,expression tree. ```
* quick, merge, topo, etc. ```sorting programs```
